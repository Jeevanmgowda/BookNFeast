- SQL-backed data with a localStorage fallback in the UI.
- Reports and dashboard with charts.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js)
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MySQL

## Project Structure
- backend/ - API server, DB setup, and seed logic
- database/ - MySQL schema, triggers, and sample DML query commands
- frontend/ - SPA UI and pages
- assets/ - shared images and icons

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MySQL 8+

### Backend
1) Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2) Create a database user and set env vars (create backend/.env)

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3307
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

3) Initialize schema

```bash
npm run db:init
```

Sample JOIN and aggregate DML commands are available in `database/dml_commands.sql`.

4) Start the API server

```bash
npm run dev
```

API runs at http://localhost:3000

### Frontend
Open frontend/index.html in your browser. For a better dev experience, use a local server (VS Code Live Server or any static file server).

## Default Admin
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

## API Overview
- GET /api/health
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/reset
- GET /api/bootstrap
- POST /api/seed

## Notes
- The UI will fallback to localStorage seed data if the backend is offline.
